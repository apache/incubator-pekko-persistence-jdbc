# Migration

* There are no Apache Pekko Persistence JDBC releases yet
* If you are looking to migrate from [Akka Persistence JDBC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/current/migration.html), you should upgrade to v5.1.x before attempting to migrate to Pekko's equivalent.
* We will provide a more detailed migration guide for switching from Akka Persistence JDBC to Pekko Persistence JDBC but the Core [Pekko Migration page](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current//project/migration-guides.html) can help, in the interim.
